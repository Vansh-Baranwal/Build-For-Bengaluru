This helps ensure **public accountability**.

---

# 🗺 City Intelligence Map

The platform includes a **geospatial visualization system**.

Using **PostGIS**, we can:

- Detect complaints within 100m
- Cluster similar issues
- Generate city heatmaps

Issue markers:

| Issue | Color |
|-----|-----|
Pothole | Red |
Garbage | Orange |
Flooding | Blue |

# 🤖 AI Powered Complaint Analysis

When a complaint is submitted:

1️⃣ The description is sent to the AI service  
2️⃣ AI extracts:

- Issue category
- Severity
- Responsible department

Example AI output:

{
  "category": "pothole",
  "severity": "high",
  "department": "Roads and Infrastructure"
}

The system then assigns **priority automatically**.

---

# 🧠 Smart Duplicate Detection

Using **PostGIS spatial queries**, NammaFix detects duplicate issues.

If multiple complaints occur within:

100 meters

they are grouped into **clusters**.

This helps authorities quickly detect **problem hotspots**.
